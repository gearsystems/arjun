title: Learning and working on new things
---

	Now that this post is a bit late i have plenty of things to write and share.Our project GEAR SYSTEMS is well on track after getting the required sponsorship and funding from our college.I have done my part in collecting surveys from across the nation and tried getting opinions of people from all age groups.The groundwork associated with this task was quite difficult owing to the lack of interest among people now a days.The fact that most of the surveys were filled by people of ages 20-30 shows that the elder generation does not have the required enthusiasm with regard to advent of new technology.Me and Rahul Yadav were assigned this task since we both have plenty of contacts in the campus as well as our hometown.



	After the mid exams again it was an oppurtunity to get in groove with the work that was lagging behind due to our academic boundations.One interesting thing that i came across was the google APIs for pie charts,bar charts etc and implemented the same in the contributors graph that keeps a graphical visualization of the contributors that are contributing to various projects under GEAR Systems project.While doing this I was able to learn AJAX that helped me modify the APIs to suit my data that was taken from the github repositories.This graph had sections for additions,deletions and commits(most important :P) with respective percentages of individual contribution.



	The Drive Nav page that helps the driver get to the destination using real time google maps had to be fixed with the waypoints and Destination routing from a sample JSON file.For the time being we'll take this data further modifications would make it more dynamic.Now we hav 4 waypoints that lead to destination where the driver can go and fix the problem.This was a real challenge since I wasnt working on that part of the project but in the end it was good that i could learn that part using basic c language constructs.


	So now that the Mid term evaluation coming up i hope we can get a positive response from our mentors and looking forward to learn better and cool new stuff.
